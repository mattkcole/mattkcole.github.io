      <description>In your R journeys you may have come across some interesting functions like apply statements or even lm. One function that is particularly helpful (and interesting) is the piping operator (%&amp;gt;%) from the magrittr pacakge. You may have noticed that the piping operator is similar to the matrix multiplcation operator %*%, in that they are both sandwitch functions (may or may not be trying to coin this term right now), as the function call is/are a symbol(s) enclosed by a % on both times.</description>
