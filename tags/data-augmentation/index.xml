      <description>You may have heard that deep learning, particularly within image recognition situations, requires huge amounts of data. Mathematically, a ‘small’ ResNet-18 model has millions of trainable parameters, and as everyone knows from statistics class - we need more training data than model parameters, right?* While it remains true that, all else equal, the more data a model has access to in training the better it will perform - there are a few tricks we can use to increase the mileage of the data which we do have.</description>
