<h4 id="background">Background</h4>

<p>A few months ago I started my journey to build my first web app, <a href="http://rentaltensor.com/">Rental Tensor</a> (excuse the horrible name ðŸ˜Ž) in order to estimate the rents for different properties at the zip code level. As a trained statistician disguised as a Techy Data Scientist I love playing with a mix of code and data, but felt like it was difficult to create anything really useful without some sort of web backbone to host or serve my projects. As the old proverb says: &ldquo;a great model stuck on your hard drive is just some code&rdquo;. While I am familiar with Shiny which can be used to serve models to real users via a web format (without leaving R!), I felt like it was time for me to learn how to host a more robust and flexible service.</p>

<h4 id="tools">Tools</h4>

<p>I was looking around at all of the different frameworks to make dynamic web applications and felt <em>extremely</em> overwhelmed. Ruby on Rails seemed like a clear &lsquo;top&rsquo; choice used by Airbnb, GitHub, and Hulu, while some companies were using all Javascript (?!). I guess PHP is still a thing that some people love, and so many other options that I had never heard of. Since I regularly use Python for work and fun, <em>and</em> is used in so many data science applications, I narrowed my search to just Python web frameworks. Now that I removed 90% of my options I simply had to choose between two options: flask and Django. Since one blog I read said something like &lsquo;Django</p>

<h4 id="learning-django">Learning Django</h4>

<p>Learning Django (enough to put together somethnig somewhat functional) consisted of following allong three totorials beforing hacking away: the classic <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/">Django Polls tutorial</a>, <a href="http://leanpub.com/tangowithdjango2/">Tango with Django</a>, and <a href="https://djangoforbeginners.com/introduction/">Django for Beginners</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/">Django Polls tutorial</a> was a great introduction that opened my mind to what was possible with Django. You take a concept (a website where people can vote on questions) and slowly build the parts needed to turn it into a reality. It really drills home the basic concepts and even shows you some of the internal mechanics that power the Django model framework.</p>

<p><a href="http://leanpub.com/tangowithdjango2/">Tango with Django</a> is much more indepth than the Polls tutorial and actually spends a bit of time explaining different web technologies that you may need to create a particular site (such as javascript and bootstrap to make your site look great). The course takes you through useful and slightly difficult (for me) to understand topics like user authentication and AJAX requests in a way that helped me actually understand them. There is also discussion of deployment options and strategies which is actually a little light on details for what I actually ended up needing. In fact, the issue of propertly deploying a &lsquo;full fledged application&rsquo; is, in my experience, the toughest part of developing my first web app. Everything was working fine on my local machine, but there were so many problems getting the static files to load, setting up a database, or even just simply getting the site to render at all on a custom domain. There were a few other blog posts that really helped in this reguard.</p>

<p><a href="https://djangoforbeginners.com/introduction/">Django for Beginners</a> was pretty neat as it was a collection of several small projects that you build from scratch. While much of the material was actually covered in the perevious two resources, this book really solitified some key concepts for me and got me feeling more comfortable in the Django environment.</p>

<h4 id="my-first-project">My first project</h4>

<p>I wanted to make a dynamic calculator that would estimate the rent for a property via scraping real rental listings. I figured this would be good first project as it was simple (the web app only does one thing - estimate rents), dynamic (we are computing estimated rents on the fly), and the application would scrape rental listings from the web (This wasn&rsquo;t something I had known how to do before). After building a web scraper using <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">Beautiful Soup</a></p>
