After a few [Wordpress blogs](https://wordpress.com/), a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) experiment and a test of [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), I've decided to get my feet wet with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Thanks to Dean for the beautiful Jekyll template, [beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll), the site is already looking nice. Hope you come along for the ride!
