<p>In your R journeys you may have come across some interesting functions like <code>apply</code> statements or even <code>lm</code>. One function that is particularly helpful (and interesting) is the piping operator (<code>%&gt;%</code>) from the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html">magrittr pacakge</a>. You may have noticed that the piping operator is similar to the matrix multiplcation operator <code>%*%</code>, in that they are both <em>sandwitch</em> functions (may or may not be trying to coin this term right now), as the function call is/are a symbol(s) enclosed by a <code>%</code> on both times. These sandwitch functions in R are actually members of a larger class of functions, known as <em>infix</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation">functions</a>. Unlike most functions such as <code>mean()</code>, <code>summary()</code>, or <code>kable()</code>, are <em>prefix</em> functions, which take their arguments after the fucntion is called (<code>mean(c(1.2,1.6,0.4,3.1)</code>). Infix fuctions on the other hand, come inbetween its (two) arguments. Other infix functions include basic addition, and subtraction (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>) and all your other common aresthmatic functions. Many in R however, are functions enclosed by a % on both side to indicate their special features. Some other examples are <code>%*%</code> (matrix multiplication), or <code>%in%</code>, <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functions.html">etc</a>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>matrix(c(1:4),2) %*% matrix(c(1,0,0,1),2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    1    3
## [2,]    2    4</code></pre>
<p>We can even define our own infix functions as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>`%+2%` &lt;- function(x, y){
return(x + y + 2)
}</code></pre>
<p>So, what would <code>1 %+2% 1</code> result in?</p>
<p>In short, while these functions are, deep down, just regular functions. They can improve readability considerably in your code - imagine needing to use <code>add(x,y)</code> whenever you had to find the sum of two numbers.</p>
<p><code>(2+2) * 10 - 6</code> would turn into <code>subtract(multiply(add(2,2),10),6)</code>. What a monster!</p>
