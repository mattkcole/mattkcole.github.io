Howdy,

I'm Matt Cole, currently a masters student at the [Johns Hopkins School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu/) in the [biostats](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) department. I'm interested in a bunch of things including tech, sustainability, and bikes.

Please, click around a while or [reach out](https://mattkcole.com/contactme) :)
