Howdy,

I'm Matt Cole,

I'm currently a student at the [Johns Hopkins School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu/) in the [biostatistics](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) department.

I previously studied Math and Biology at [Sacred Heart University](http://www.sacredheart.edu/).

I'm interested in a bunch of things including tech, sustainability, and bikes.

I don't think I can distill my life to a markdown page so feel free to
[reach out](https://mattkcole.com/contactme) or click around.
