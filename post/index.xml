      <title>Dplyr‚Äôs select - tips and tricks</title>

      <description>It‚Äôs not the most interesting function, or even that much fun. But dplyr‚Äôs select has a lot of functionality that is often overlooked. All select does is ‚Äòselect‚Äô columns, yet understanding some of its functionality deeper than surface level saves me a bunch of time in my day-to-day work. Let‚Äôs take a tour of where dplyr::select can save you time too, by calling out situations where I find myself using the function over and over again.</description>

      <title>So, you tested positive for COVID-19 - Do you actually have the virus?</title>

      <description>Testing positive for the Coronavirus doesn‚Äôt mean one actually has a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Like statistical models, one might say that all medical tests are flawed*, but some (hopefully all that we make decisions based off of) are useful. While creating these tests, scientists balance cost (in many ways), speed, generalizability, and of course, accuracy. Most of the time, in the case of a binary test (ex. you are pregnant or you are not, etc.</description>

      <title>Hacking together my first web app in Django</title>

      <description>Background A few months ago I started my journey to build my first web app, Rental Tensor (excuse the horrible name üòé) in order to estimate the rents for different properties at the zip code level. As a trained statistician disguised as a techy Data Scientist, I love playing with a mix of code and data, but I feel that it can sometimes be difficult for models or data pipelines to be very valuable without some sort of web backbone to host and serve it.</description>

      <title>Pie Charts - What‚Äôs the big deal?</title>

      <description>In data visualization there are many unspoken rules which are ‚Äòunderstood‚Äô to be correct. Don‚Äôt plot in 3-D, don‚Äôt display column/bar charts on a logarithmic scale, don‚Äôt use two y-axes (or dare I say - more than two), and never never ever use pie charts. Yet pie charts remain common, especially in business, and some in the statistical/data science community just absolutely love to hate them.
Don‚Äôt just take my word for it, even the help function in base R for pie charts (?</description>

      <description>Since the creation of the devtools package, it‚Äôs easier than ever to make and share R packages. This freedom has allowed pacakges to avoid the seemingly archaic process of submitting to CRAN, waiting for feedback, resubmitting‚Ä¶ - While in the past, avoiding CRAN meant a significantly reduced audiance for your package, nowadays, easily posting to github means your pacakge is available to nearly every R user via devtools::install_github() not to mention other sources such as bitbucket or svn.</description>

      <title>Understanding Food Trends: A Baysian Approach to Forecasting Chipotle</title>

      <description>Since food is such an important aspect of life and public health, I thought it would be exciting to look at food trends over time. Obviously food choices drive public health, but I figured that trends were just this - trends, preferences that may change over time. While a bit broad, I narrowed down ‚Äòfood trends‚Äô to be interest in Chipotle Mexican Grill - a fan favorite - over time. Since I don‚Äôt readily have any real Chipotle sales data, I decided to make my own - well, kinda.</description>

      <title>The seeds of reproducibility - a 2 minute crash course</title>

      <description>While a Teaching Assistant for the 620 Biostatistics sequence at JHU (Statistical Methods in Public Health) one issue came up fairly regularly, the idea of seeds and reproducing results when sometimes non-obvious random elements are involved.
Many analyses are dependent on some sort of random number generation, weather it be from cross-validation, bootstrapping, imputing, or simulating, it‚Äôs inevitable that you‚Äôll need these processes. Because of the nature of ‚Äòrandom‚Äô things, reproducibility can be tough.</description>

      <title>Beyond %&gt;%, Alternative Pipes in R</title>

      <description>Data scientists and the Mario Brothers agree - pipes rock.
If you have been using R for data ‚Äòplumbing‚Äô/wrangling etc. you have undoubtedly came across the fantastic dplyr package and then by default, the the standard pipe.
The pipes we will be discussing today are from the magrittr pacakge, which is where dplyr‚Äôs ‚Äòstandard‚Äô pipe comes from (repo is here). Straight from the highly recommended magrittr vignette, the purpose of pipes and the magrittr package itself is to ‚Äúdecrease development time and to improve readability and maintainability of code‚Äù - who wouldn‚Äôt like that?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on an R package for factor analysis visualization for a while now, and ran into an interesting problem. One function in FAtools is essentially a wrapper for several functions in the nFactors package, which plots and displays both graphical and non graphical scree test solutions. It&amp;rsquo;s a handy way for people to look a little more closely at the number of factors to extract (although, I would argue not enough).</description>

      <title>Looking Both Ways - Infix Functions</title>

      <description>In your R journeys you may have come across some interesting functions like apply statements or even lm. One function that is particularly helpful (and interesting) is the piping operator (%&amp;gt;%) from the magrittr pacakge. You may have noticed that the piping operator is similar to the matrix multiplcation operator %*%, in that they are both sandwitch functions (may or may not be trying to coin this term right now), as the function call is/are a symbol(s) enclosed by a % on both times.</description>

      <description>Q: What does modeling the number of people buying gelato in Venice using cultural data and environmental attributes have in common with assessing which measures of reading speed are most related to glaucoma propensity?
A: A strong need for variable selection.
Whenever we consider estimating the relationship between two variables, say \(x\) and \(y\), we need to contemplate what other factors may be associated with those of interest and whether or not to include them in our model.</description>
